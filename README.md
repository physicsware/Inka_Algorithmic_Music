## Overview
inkamusic creates instrumental music, based on rules. This includes structure, rhythm, melody, harmonization and instrumentation. A simple web interface (with CherryPy) offers the possibility to choose from several options. The output format is a MIDI file that can be played with many applications, e.g. Garageband or VLC on MacOS or Windows Media Player on Windows. Or try https://musescore.org/en, which not only plays the midi files, but also displays the score.
